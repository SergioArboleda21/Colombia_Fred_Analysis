# Colombia_Fred_Analysis

This repository contains a deep-dive analysis into the key drivers of the Colombian economy, aimed at providing actionable insights for economic policymakers and foreign investors.
Goal: To model the Colombian economy by analyzing how its GDP is influenced by trade, currency fluctuations, inflation, and interest rates.
Methodology: Seven distinct economic indicators from FRED with mismatched frequencies were cleaned and resampled into a uniform quarterly dataset. The analysis included creating a correlation matrix, building a multiple regression model (which explained 79.2% of GDP variance), and using a Granger causality test to check for predictive relationships.
Key Finding: The analysis identifies exports as the primary engine of Colombia's economic growth, highlighting significant volatility. It also uncovers a strong feedback loop where a weakening peso directly correlates with higher inflation and housing costs. Finally, it confirms that monetary policy (interest rates) has a significant but delayed impact on inflation, typically taking 9-12 months.
